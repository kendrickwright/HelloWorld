Great quotes from Thomas Edison:

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Just because something doesn't do what you planned it to do doesn't mean it's useless.
I never did a day's work in my life. It was all fun.
To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits.
There is no substitute for hard work.
I have friends in overalls whose friendship I would not swap for the favor of the kings of the world.
